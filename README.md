# Compactyl - A Compact Dactyl ManuForm Keyboard

This is a fork of the [okke fork](https://github.com/okke-formsma/dactyl-manuform-tight) of the [l4u fork](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard) of the [tshort fork](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard), a parameterized, split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard.

## Planned V5.0 Features
- Add fourth thumb keys
- Update USB holder for bastardkb pcb mcu holder v1.4 (TODO may fit blackpill version as well)
- Rotate and adjust lower two keys further away along Y and Z to make compatible with taller keycap profiles on alpha
- Adjust key heights to return to some of the design ideas I was trying out with [the dactyl hobbitform](https://github.com/dereknheiley/ibnuda.dactyl-keyboard) for small hands
	- Adjust column heights, ring finger lower on Z, middle and index columns higher on Z
	- Increase curvature of pinky column to bring bottom alpha and num row closer to finger
	- Raise numrow slightly along Z axis
- TODO add ready to print risers with slots to increase palm rest height

## V4.1 Features
- Added diode holder under switch for kailh hotswap socket. Holds the diode in an secure way so you can bend the wires around for easier soldering. Inspired by [Stingray](https://github.com/stingray127/handwirehotswap), [50an6xy06r6n](https://github.com/50an6xy06r6n/hotswap_pcb_generator) and [rmtz](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/7ueojw/my_na%C3%AFve_attempt_at_making_my_own_keyboard/) solderless sockets.

## V4.0 Features
- Cleaned up threaded insert holes for two-part case
- Raised thumb cluster and adjusted thumb cluster angle
- Added [DES "MT4"](https://github.com/dereknheiley/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) rendered keycap preview with per-row profile and custom outer column keycaps
- Adjust tolerances around usb-holder to slide in more easily
- Lengthen USB holder for 35mm pro-micro-usb-c controllers
- Add more room for TRRS jack in USB holder
- Make vertical USB-holder easier to print with thicker "bottom"
- NOTE: you will probably have to increase OpenSCAD params:
	- Turn off rendering at ~10,000,000 
	- CGAL cache size ~8000mb
	- PolySet cache size ~8000mb

- NOTE: you will probably have to increase OpenSCAD params:
	- Turn off rendering at ~2,000,000 
	- CGAL cache size ~4000mb
	- PolySet cache size ~4000mb
![Compactyl V2 back](images/compactyl-V2.1-back.png)

## V2.0 Features
- Returned back to one solid piece top case deisgn for easier printing
- Subtraced space around keycaps to improve clearances
	- better clearance on top row for middle and ring finger keys
	- thick ABS caps still not recommended
- Adjusted stagger and column height deltas
- Extended bottom plate to connect wrist rest
	- Wrist rest can be positioned to adjust X, Y, or Z placement (adding or removing shims)
- Added modified version of cyrstalhands wrist rest holder
	- slanted, removed case connector tubes, added threaded insert holes

## V1.0 Features
- Hotswap north facing switch plates
- Increase pinky stagger
- Adjusted column spacing for better clearance
- Continuous (vs. recessed) bottom plate with filleted holes
- Exoskeleton top case design
- Rendered both 4x6 and 5x6 versions with bottom plate
- (orig. Tightyl) As small around the keys as possible
- (orig. Tightyl) Smoother transition between thumb and fingers (less facets)
- (orig. Tightyl) Thicker walls in steep regions where walls were too thin

## Update USB holder
- Created ("working" but unpolished) SCAD version of USB holder for modifications
- Provide better clearance to USB cables plugging into controller
- Adjust size to better hold Elite-C controller
- Taper angle to reduce waste material
- Make holder shape symetrical to case notches so it fits upside down or right side up
- Add option for square reset button to be held as well

## Wiring
- Uses typical COL2ROW diode direction and pins for dactyl manuform
- Should be backwards compatible with dactyl-manuform 5x6 firmware from
	- https://config.qmk.fm/#/handwired/dactyl_manuform/5x6/LAYOUT_5x6
	- https://github.com/Oh-Keycaps/firmwares#how-to-just-download-our-firmware

## Tools & Supplies [Full amazon wish list of equipment](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/18NL4T59KM4AE?ref_=wl_share)
- Soldering iron & stand, at least 50 watt
- No clean lead free solder in 21awg, or 25awg for smaller SMD components [lead solder is easier to flow, but be careful](https://www.wellpcb.com/lead-free-solder-vs-lead-solder.html)
- Silicone covered 26awg (0.405mm) wire
- Long tip gluegun, at least 60 watt

## Comparison with original Tightyl
- Orig. Tightyl (white) had more row curvature, and wider spaceing between columns
- New Compactyl (blue) uses a flatter row curvature, but increases tent to result in similar keyboard angle
- New Compactyl (blue) is approximately 4mm taller (plus additional heigh for bottom plate if used) because of space requried by hot swap holders below pinky columns.

## Generate OpenSCAD and STL models

**Setting up the Clojure environment**
* [Install the Clojure runtime](https://clojure.org)
* [Install the Leiningen project manager](http://leiningen.org/)
* [Install OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/)

### Generating a Design
* Run `lein auto generate`
* This will regenerate the `things/*.scad` files whenever the .clr file is saved
* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design in `src/dactyl_keyboard/dactyl.clj`, open scad files will auto regenerate, OpenSCAD will rerender.
* When done, use OpenSCAD to render, then export model STL files which can be printed by 3d printer slicing software.

### Batch (parallel) Processing
* Edit the path for OpenSCAD in `create-models.sh` if needed
* Change any other settings for which files you want to render
* Wait for STL files to appear (this may take a minute or two) 

## Tips

* I gave up trying to keep good values for both 4x6 and 5x6 options. So when adjusting the number of rows / cols, or tenting angles, (amoung other larger design changes) you will most likely have to update some magic numbers. I recommend opening the test.scad file and manipulate:
	* defn column-curvature 
	* defn centerrow
	* def centercol
	* defn column-offset
	* def keyboard-z-offset
	* def wrist-rest-z-height-adj
	* defn usb-holder-offset-coordinates
	* defn screw-insert-all-shapes
	* defn top-screw-insert-all-shapes
	* other magic numbers, collect them all :D
* When trying things out, 10 seconds of rendering time in OpenSCAD is really annoying. Load one of the test outputs with commented out parts that you aren't changing / don't use.
* If you're not sure what things are generted by a piece of code, color them in using something like
`(->> SOMETHING_HERE (color RED))` (see examples in dactyl.clj).
